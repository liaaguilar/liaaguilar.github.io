          Question 1: What was the first thing you paid attention to when
          interacting with the experience?
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The first thing that caught my eye was the combination of static and
            moving elements in the main screen, before you interacted with it at
            all. The looping video of the designer himself as a background
            alongside the white texts and UI elements surrounding it, creates a
            cohesive visual hierarchy. <br />
            <br />
            As I scrolled, I was particularly impressed on the responsive
            behaviour of the white text elements. This scrolling interaction,
            combined with the looping video shrinking in size, felt very smooth,
            and wasn’t clunky even if I scrolled up instead of down.
            <br /><br />
            Another element that immediately stood out was the custom cursor,
            which resembled a digital pen that is drawing. This choice
            distinguishes the designer’s website from others but also encourages
            playful exploration and interaction. Its fluid motion and
            responsiveness make navigation feel more tactile and purposeful.

              Observed the starting page visuals and noticed the lack of

              surprised by the sudden horizontal movement, rather than the

          Question 3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time
          engaging with?
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The part of the experience that I spend the most time on engaging
            with was the process of navigating through the different sections of
            the website through scrolling. The unconventional navigation style,
            which basically forces you to scroll through all his work to get to
            the end of the page, was very interesting and dynamic, encouraging
            me to explore the rest of his website. Each section flowed
            seamlessly into the next, which made me find myself revisiting
            different project pages and pieces, drawn in by the motion,
            typography and interactivity. The lack of traditional navigation
            forced me to rely on visual cues, making the act of discovering
            content feel more immersive. <br /><br />
            Beyond navigation through scrolling, I spent a lot of time analysing
            and appreciating the artistic and technical aspects of how he
            presented his projects. The mix of video and imagery, dynamic text
            placement, hierarchy, movement and balance showcased not only his
            projects, but also his creative skill and his design philosophy.

        <h2>
          Question 4: What was the most common action in your two-minute
          interaction with the experience?
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            My most common action that I performed was scrolling. The sites
            navigation basically hinges on scrolling, and it’s designed in a way
            that encourages continuous movement, with smooth transitions that
            create a sense of fluidity. Unlike other more common websites with
            static bars and navigation, it is obvious that the designer likes to
            focus on experimental approaches that focus on smooth movements and
            visuals that unfolds as the user scrolls through. <br /><br />
            I found myself constantly scrolling back and forth, seeing how the
            different sections shifted in relation to each other. Even though
            traditional navigation bars are probably more efficient in getting
            from point A to point B, as a portfolio website, it showcases the
            designers amazing creativity, even through just a simple act of
            scrolling.

          Question 5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of
          the interactive experience?
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The primary goal is to serve as Rich Brown’s digital portfolio that
            showcases his artistic identity and technical expertise. This is
            done in a way that is not just informative but also engaging through
            guiding the viewers through dynamic visuals. This website functions
            as an extension of himself, his artistic practice and a way to
            showcase his skills whilst promoting his previous work. By
            prioritizing interactivity, motion and visuals, the site encourages
            visitors to explore and engage rather than to just passively browse.
            It showcases how he is a creator and knows how to blend design and
            user engagement in a digital space and reinforces its purpose by
            integrating information on how to contact him, external links, and
            embedded media.

        <h2>
          Question 6: How does the interactive experience communicate this
          primary goal?
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            This goal is communicated through the display of curated selections
            of the creator’s achievements and projects in an easily navigated
            format. It uses a consistent design style that reflects the
            creator’s personal aesthetic, as well as his content and creation
            skills. The interface is very interesting and engaging which helps
            reflect his skills in marketing himself and others. <br /><br />
            The interactive experience communicates its goal through intentional
            design choices that reflect his identity as a designer. The homepage
            immediately stands out and catches the visitors attention with a
            looping video of himself, establishing a connection as well as
            setting the tone for who he is. The smooth animations and custom
            cursor turn simple actions into engaging interactions, showcasing
            his skills of turning something small, into something better to
            enhance user experience. These subtle changes demonstrate his skills
            in design, typography, UI/UX and visual hierarchy, but most
            importantly, his attention to detail. <br /><br />
            The most obvious part of how this website showcases his artistic
            identity is the links and embedded media of all his works. The
            website takes you through a journey, exploring all his different
            work, explanations, achievements, results, locations, and basically
            anything that you can think of related to each work. It highlights
            his professional reach and makes it easy for potential clients to
            see the work and want to work with him. He makes it easy to reach
            him by also adding external links to his different social medias so
            employers can easily connect and reach out to him. Because of this,
            it transforms the website as a functional tool for self-promotion
            and a digital portfolio.

          Question 7: What is your impression of how the experience should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The website appears to be designed primarily for a short-term and
            goal-oriented interaction, serving as an impactful digital
            portfolio, rather than an ongoing place for continuous engagement.
            Users are likely to visit the site with a specific purpose, such as
            evaluating his work for a potential project or employment
            opportunity and explore it all in a single session. The absence of
            frequently updated content such as blogs and personalized user
            pathways, suggests that the site is not intended for repeated
            visits, other than revisiting his work when needed. <br /><br />
            While users may only visit briefly, its memorable design and
            experience creates a lasting impact and may inspire designers,
            developers and other creators, while also encouraging employers to
            reach out. Because of its unique design, repeated visits may occur
            from those who are analysing and studying its code and execution.

          Question 8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it
          should be interacted with over time?
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Through its structure and design choices, the website signals a
            one-time interaction. The curated and linear format leads through
            Brown’s portfolio, and the visually interesting design through
            boldness and interactivity encourage immediate exploration rather
            than consistent long-term engagement. <br /><br />
            The strongest indicator of short-term interaction is the lack of
            updating content. No sections for updates, no blog posts and no
            features that encourage user participation (like customization
            options, etc.), the users are just exploring his portfolio, which is
            his intention. This reinforces that the visitors are meant to
            consume the content once, and the way he keeps the viewers’
            attention is through his dynamic interaction design, and his
            striking visuals. The UI, dynamic and custom cursor, immersive
            navigation elements are all very impressive and impactful designs,
            but they all feature controlled exploration rather than user
            interaction. It’s meant to inform and impress, not for repeated
            visits, and the website does it extremely well.

          Question 9: What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the
          experience reference?
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The experience draws inspiration from multiple digital media forms,
            particularly motion graphics, interactive storytelling and
            experimental web design. The smooth animated transitions, fluid
            cursor movements and dynamic scrolling is commonly used in multiple
            interactive medias. <br /><br />
            The website also follows animation principles through sequencing and
            looping, the way the homepage continuously loops and elements
            disappear and appear based on scrolling. It is sequenced as one
            thing always come after another, like a directed experience.
            <br /><br />
            The typography and layout have influences from editorial prints and
            designs, where text overlays images in a dynamic way, kind of
            mimicking magazine spreads or posters. It presents his artistic
            abilities and his widespread influences.

          <p>
            The reference to magazine spreads and publications suggest that the
            user should engage with the site as if they are exploring a gallery
            or editorial feature and should approach it with an exploratory
            mindset. The design invites a slower, more intention interaction
            style that promotes observation, immersion and appreciation for the
            designer’s work. The experience is not just about quickly finding
            information, its more about browsing and recognizing his art and
            design.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            One of the most frustrating aspects of the website was the lack of
            clear direction in the initial starting page. I wasn’t sure how to
            navigate the page at first and there were no obvious buttons to
            click, like a taskbar that most website shave. The dense visual
            layout created an overstimulating experience at times, even though
            it was visually striking. The small typography also made it kind of
            hard to read certain paragraphs, prompting me to just move on
            instead of reading the text. The lack of clear hierarchy also might
            pose as an issue or frustration for those who aren’t familiar with
            experimental web design or non-standard websites.

          <p>
            Despite some minor frustration, that fluid scrolling animation was
            the most satisfying element of the interaction. The seamless
            transitions from different sections provided continuity, making
            browsing feel effortless. I didn’t feel like there was an ‘end’ or a

            It also contributed to a polish and professional tone of the site,
            as the visuals always guided me smoothly from section to the next.
            This creates a visually cohesive experience that encourages deeper
